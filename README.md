The repository contains several workbooks that demonstrate basic Excel skills.

The first is a worksheet with two datasets and a lookup table. The skills demonstrated:
* A VLOOKUP function is nested inside a SUMIF function
* Absolute and relative cell references are incorporated to allow formula copying
* Three datasets are pulled into one dashboard
* SUMIFS is used to sum outstanding receivables from a list of accounting data.
* SUMIFS used to filter for outstanding receivables by client that are more than 30 days old.
* A date is hard coded rather than utilizing "=NOW()" to retrieve today's date.

The second is a workbook with a relatively large dataset on one sheet. The skills demonstrated:
* Pivot Tables created using different selected metrics.
* Visualizations, e.g. bar and line charts.
* Slicers.
* Statistical analysis of dataset.
